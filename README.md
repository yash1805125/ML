# ML
Machine Learning 
In this repository I have attached my ML learnings and some small projects which I did after learning about basic Python libraries and, the procedure to carry out machine learning operations. I have two projects:-
1. A classification based project where we need to predict if a patient is going to have a heart-disease, based on the previous data record provided to a machine to learn.
2. A regression project where we need to predict the actual price of a bulldozer in future, based on the previous data provided.
